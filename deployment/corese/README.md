This directory provides the necessary script and configuration file to start Corese with a server profile that will load
all existing ServiceDescription.ttl and ShapesGraph.ttl into named graphs.

### How to use

Edit script `corese-server.sh` and customize variable 'CORESE' and 'SMSPATH' if needed.

Script `corese-server.sh` edits `corese-profile-sms.ttl` and replaces '{INSTALL}' with the actual path where the SPARQL micro-services code is installed.


Then, run:
```bash
./ corese-server.sh &
```

Wait a few seconds for Corese to be initialized (no more trace should appear anymore).
To test if Corese is working properly, run the command below to display all loaded named graphs.
the variable `Q` is the URL-encoded version of SPARQL query: `select distinct ?g where { graph ?g { ?s ?p ?o } }`

```bash
Q='elect%20distinct%20%3Fg%0Awhere%20%7B%20graph%20%3Fg%20%7B%20%3Fs%20%3Fp%20%3Fo%20%7D%20%7D'
curl --header "Accept: application/sparql-results+json" "http://localhost:8081/sparql?query=$Q"
```
